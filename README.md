# IT647-Project
A simple website development site I made for my IT647 class.
The requirement was to make a website for the fictitious SNHU-a-Palooza concert.
It needed:
  1. An index page
  2. Details page with Google calendar embedded showing the dates of the concert series
  3. A registration page which generates a unique registration ID.
  4. A printable version of the registration
  
I added a login page so users can retrieve their information and print it using their email address to retrieve the info from the mySQL DB.

I utilized CSS for the entire site design, including the navigation menu.

PHP was used to interact between the forms and the mySQL DB.
